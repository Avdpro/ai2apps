# Applictions
Cokecodes currently has a **desktop** and 3 major PWA dev-tools: **Terminal**, **Diskit** and **CCEditor**:

- [Teriminal](terminal/README.md) is a **UNIX terminal** like app.

- [CCEdit](ccedit/README.md) is a **Code Editor** with strong feature set.

- [Diksit](diskit/README.md) is the **File Manger**  

All these tools is also in their early development stage. They will be more powerful while CokeCodes improving. Also, more tools will join them.

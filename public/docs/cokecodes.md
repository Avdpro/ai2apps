# Tab-OS conecpt preview

## What is Tab-OS?
Tab-OS is a virtual OS in Web. 
It brings the essence of modern OS (like MacOS, Windows, Linux) into browsers.  
With tools and apps in Tab-OS, WEB and application developers can work (design and code) just in the browser. No need to setup native environment or install native apps.   
Now, almost 100% Tab-OS itself's codes are written in Tab-OS.  
  
## Why work in browser?
There are indeed a lot of benefits compare to working in native OS:  
- **No System Contamination**: Setup a new project work environment won't install anything to native OS or make any changes out side the browser. 
Your computer/ device always stay clean. 

- **Domain Sandbox**: By the browser' nature, data is strongly isolated between domains. 
You can think each domain-sandbox as a sand-alone computer. You can have unlimited **dedicate OS/ computer for each project**.  
Compare to virtual machines, domain sandboxes are super efficient.  Start and switch between them is lightning fast. Removing a sandbox cleans everything.   
The under-developing Tab-OS' **Multiverse** app can create, backup, restore and manage your domain sandboxes.  

- **It's Good**: Tools and applications in Tab-OS work just as good as similar tools run in native OS. They launch in a blink, and run smoothly.  
Especially comparing to container-runtimes like node.js apps, browsers' Javascript VM can be even faster. 

- **It's Better**: Utilized modern browsers' advanced features, design and coding in browser can be even better than in native OS! For example, **HMR mechanism** works in browser cost much less effort comparing to implements in native OS.

- **Full Stack**: Yes, you can write server codes and debug them in browser, even when you offline! In this concept preview, you can start a HTTP REST API server in browser and access it in your client web page/ app, just like it runs in a native OS.  
Debug javascript server code in browser is far more efficient than other ways.   
**Express and Fastify** will be supported in coming Tab-OS version.

- **Any Device, Anytime**: Browsers are best cross-platform-environment out there. Tab-OS can run on all major modern browsers **desktop and mobile**. With inbuilt cloud feature, you can easily pick up your work any where, anytime. 

## Productivity
- **No need to be connected:** As PWA apps, all Tab-OS tools/ apps can and mostly work offline. You won't concern about the network connection while working. 

- **Cloud repository**: OS images, projects can be synced and share with Tab-OS' cloud repository. You can access your works anytime, anywhere, on any devices.  
Public clouds (OneDrive, DropBox, GitHub) support is on the way.

- **Packages**: Tab-OS inbuilt a package system. Apps, tools and libs are delivered and installed as packages. With minor modifications, most node.js packages can be port into browser. 
You can make your own packages and share with others too.  
Npm packages support is also incoming.  

## Open to more power ups
Tab-OS' system, applications and command tools are all written in javascript and **mostly open source**. 
After understanding how it works, you can easily make your own tools, add-ons, and applications to aid your work and share with other developers.  

With the incoming **Tab-OS Sub Host** tool, you can host your own Tab-OS server, keep your work private or behind your company firewall.

## Incomming more
This version of Tab-OS is still a concept preview. It proves it's possible to work with in tool-chain in browser. 
Current Tab-OS is in early stage. More features are incoming, check the [**Roadmap**](roadmap.md)  and stay tuned!

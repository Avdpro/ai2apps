# Third-party code notices

The Oobleck VAE and SnakeBeta implementation in `modeling_vae.py` is derived
from stable-audio-tools commit `a6ae0cdf8b2eb1567a4b42ceadddec3712d99d45`.
The module hierarchy, weight normalization and activation equations preserve
the checkpoint's original inference implementation.

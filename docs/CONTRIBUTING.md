# Contributing to oMLX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to oMLX! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/jundot/omlx)
2. Clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/omlx.git
cd omlx
```

3. Install development dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

> **Note**: oMLX requires Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) and Python 3.10+.

## Development Workflow

### Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
# Fast tests only (recommended during development)
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_config.py -v

# Run slow tests (requires model files)
pytest -m slow
```

**Test markers:**

| Marker | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `@pytest.mark.slow` | Tests that require loading models |
| `@pytest.mark.integration` | Tests that require a running server |

**Test file naming:** For a source file `omlx/<module>.py`, the test file should be `tests/test_<module>.py`.

When modifying source code, always check if existing tests are affected and update them accordingly. New code should include corresponding tests.

### License Header

Source files use the repository's Apache 2.0 default unless they are listed as
exceptions in `LICENSE-POLICY.md`. Default-licensed files should include:

```python
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

Files covered by the AI2Apps Official Cloud Connector license must retain:

```python

Do not move code across this license boundary without confirming copyright and
license compatibility. Contributions to a covered Connector file are submitted
under that file's current license and its stated future Change License.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork & branch** — Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

2. **Make changes** — Write code and tests following the style guidelines above.

3. **Test** — Ensure all related tests pass:
   ```bash
   pytest tests/test_<affected_module>.py -v
   ```

4. **Submit** — Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`. Describe what changed and why.

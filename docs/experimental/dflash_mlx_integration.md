# DFlash-MLX Integration Report

Date: 2026-07-28

## Overview

DFlash is a block diffusion speculative decoding technique (arXiv:2602.06036) that accelerates LLM token generation by having a small draft model propose multiple tokens simultaneously, which the target model verifies in a single forward pass. The MLX implementation ([bstnxbt/dflash-mlx](https://github.com/bstnxbt/dflash-mlx)) has been integrated into oMLX as an experimental engine option.

---

## Architecture

### How DFlash works

```
1. PREFILL: target model processes entire prompt, captures hidden states
2. DRAFT:   draft model generates block of 16 tokens in parallel (block diffusion)
3. VERIFY:  target model verifies all 16 in one forward pass
4. ACCEPT:  greedy prefix match — longest matching prefix is committed
5. REPLAY:  cache rollback via tape replay for hybrid (GatedDeltaNet) models
6. REPEAT:  until max_tokens or EOS
```

Key distinction from traditional speculative decoding: the draft model uses **block diffusion** (parallel denoising) rather than autoregressive token-by-token drafting, allowing all 16 tokens to be proposed simultaneously.

```

DFlashEngine is a `BaseEngine` implementation that:
- Loads target + draft models via `dflash_mlx.runtime.load_target_bundle()` / `load_draft_bundle()`
- Consumes structured events from `stream_dflash_generate()` (prefill, token, summary)
- Bridges sync generation to async streaming via `asyncio.Queue`
- Holds an internal fallback engine for long-context requests

### Supported models

DFlash upstream registers `QwenGdnTargetOps` and `Gemma4TargetOps`. oMLX also registers a Laguna backend and the `DFlashLagunaForCausalLM` drafter used by Poolside's official checkpoints:

| Target model | Draft checkpoint |
|--------------|-----------------|

| poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-NVFP4(-mlx) | poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-NVFP4 |

Other model families (Llama, Gemma3, etc.) are not supported — they require both a trained DFlash draft checkpoint and a compatible target adapter in dflash-mlx.

Laguna target and draft checkpoints must be from the same size family and should
use Poolside's quantization-matched draft when one is published (for example,
`Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-NVFP4` with the NVFP4 target). The adapter validates target
depth, hidden size, and capture-layer IDs at load time. It implements Laguna's
per-head/per-element softplus attention gating, partial RoPE,
per-captured-layer RMS normalization, Poolside's fused `qkv_proj` checkpoint
layout, mixed full/sliding target caches, and rejection rollback. DDTree
verification, target KV quantization, and the specialized verify-linear path
are deliberately disabled for Laguna until they have dedicated
numerical-parity coverage; ordinary adaptive DFlash verification remains
available.

Note: the `-DFlash` suffix is specific to DFlash draft checkpoints. Gemma4 also ships an `-assistant` variant (e.g. `gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-assistant`) that targets MTP speculative decoding via mlx-vlm — do not mix these in the DFlash toggle.

## Generation flow

### Short context (< DFLASH_MAX_CTX)

1. `DFlashEngine.stream_generate()` tokenizes prompt
2. Submits to MLX executor thread via `_run_generate_streaming()`
3. Calls `stream_dflash_generate()` from dflash-mlx
4. dflash-mlx internally handles:
   - Target model prefill + hidden state capture
   - Draft model block diffusion (16 tokens per cycle)
   - Target model verification (single forward pass)
   - Greedy/temperature acceptance matching
   - Tape-based cache rollback for hybrid models (RecurrentRollbackCache)
5. omlx consumes structured events:
   - `"event": "token"` → decode with `NaiveStreamingDetokenizer` → SSE chunk
   - `"event": "summary"` → log metrics (tok/s, acceptance ratio, cycles)
6. EOS tokens filtered from output

### Long context (>= DFLASH_MAX_CTX)

1. `DFlashEngine.stream_generate()` detects prompt length exceeds threshold
2. Delegates entire request to `_fallback_engine.stream_generate()`
3. Fallback engine is BatchedEngine or VLMBatchedEngine (started during `DFlashEngine.start()`)
4. Full omlx features available: paged cache, SSD cache, prefix cache, continuous batching

### Non-streaming

`DFlashEngine.generate()` uses `generate_dflash_once()` for non-streaming requests with the same fallback logic.

---

## Temperature sampling

### Implementation (fork patch)

The original dflash-mlx uses greedy argmax only. Our fork (`jundot/dflash-mlx@8e1df22`) adds `sample_with_temperature()`:

```python
def sample_with_temperature(logits, temperature, suppress_token_mask=None):
    if temperature < 1e-5:
        return greedy_tokens_with_mask(logits, suppress_token_mask)  # greedy
    scaled = logits / temperature
    return mx.random.categorical(scaled).astype(mx.uint32)           # stochastic
```

Applied to all three sampling points: prefill first token, draft block, and verify posterior.

### Behavior

- **temp=0**: identical to original greedy behavior. Every emitted token = target model's argmax. Lossless, bit-for-bit reproducible.
- **temp>0**: both draft and verify use temperature sampling. Acceptance is still prefix-match based, so acceptance rate drops (draft and target are less likely to agree on stochastic samples). Speed benefit is reduced but diversity is achieved.

### Paper reference

The DFlash paper (arXiv:2602.06036) evaluates both temperature=0 (4.9x speedup) and temperature=1 (4.1x speedup) on H200 GPUs, confirming the algorithm supports non-greedy sampling.

---

## Constraints and limitations

### 1. Single-request engine

DFlashEngine processes one request at a time. No continuous batching — the entire GPU is dedicated to a single draft/verify loop. For concurrent users, requests are serialized on the MLX executor thread.

**Mitigation**: for Apple Silicon personal use (1-2 concurrent users), single-request 3-4x speed improvement outweighs batching benefits.

### 2. Context length limit

DFlash effectiveness degrades with long contexts:
- Draft model trained on max sequence length 3072-4096 tokens
- Verify pass attention cost grows with KV cache size
- Default `DFLASH_MAX_CTX = 4096` (configurable via environment variable)
- Beyond threshold, automatic fallback to BatchedEngine/VLMBatchedEngine

### 3. Model support

Qwen, Gemma4, and Laguna have compatible target adapters and published draft checkpoints. Each additional model family still requires:
- A trained DFlash draft checkpoint (block diffusion model matching target hidden dimensions)
- Support in dflash-mlx's target model handling (hidden state extraction, cache rollback)

### 4. Memory overhead

DFlashEngine loads both target and draft models simultaneously:
- Draft model: typically ~1B parameters (small relative to target)
- Draft int4 quantization available to reduce footprint
- Fallback engine also loaded (for long-context requests) — shares the same model weights via mlx-lm if model path matches

### 5. No paged/SSD cache

DFlashEngine does not use omlx's paged KV cache or SSD cache system. Cache is managed entirely within dflash-mlx's generation loop. Each request does full prefill from scratch (no prefix cache reuse across requests).

**Mitigation**: long-context requests (where prefix caching matters most) fall back to BatchedEngine which has full paged + SSD cache support.

### 6. No batch benchmark

Admin panel benchmark's batch throughput test is skipped for DFlashEngine since it requires scheduler core access (`engine._engine`) that DFlashEngine doesn't expose. Single-request benchmark tests work normally.

### 7. Greedy verification with temperature

When temperature > 0, acceptance rate drops because draft and target independently sample from the logit distribution. The accepted tokens are always valid target model samples at the given temperature, but fewer draft tokens get accepted per cycle, reducing the speed benefit.

## Fallback mechanism

```
DFlashEngine.start()
  ├── load target model (dflash-mlx)
  ├── load draft model (dflash-mlx)
  └── start fallback engine
        ├── VLMBatchedEngine (if model detected as VLM)
        └── BatchedEngine (otherwise)

Request arrives:
  ├── len(prompt_tokens) < DFLASH_MAX_CTX → DFlash path
  └── len(prompt_tokens) >= DFLASH_MAX_CTX → fallback engine path

DFlashEngine.start() fails:
  └── engine_pool catches exception → creates VLMBatchedEngine or BatchedEngine directly
```

### Engine pool priority

DFlash check runs **before** engine type routing in `_load_engine()`. If `dflash_enabled=True` and `dflash_draft_model` is set, DFlashEngine is created regardless of whether the model would normally be VLM or LLM. On failure, falls back to the model's natural engine type.

## Testing

### Unit tests

- ModelSettings: default values, serialization roundtrip, removed field handling
- DFlashEngine: properties, stats, cache stats
- EnginePool routing: disabled/enabled/draft model checks
- Laguna: native-forward parity, hidden-state capture, full/rotating-cache rollback, gated draft forward, target binding, and fused-QKV checkpoint loading

### Manual testing

1. Enable DFlash in admin UI for a supported model
2. Set the matching draft model path (for example, `poolside/Laguna-S-2.1-DFlash-NVFP4` for an NVFP4 Laguna S target)
3. Reload model
4. Send short prompt → verify DFlash logs (acceptance ratio, tok/s)
5. Send long prompt (>4K tokens) → verify fallback to BatchedEngine logs

## Future work

- **Upstream sync**: merge temperature patch to bstnxbt/dflash-mlx, update pin
- **Broader model support**: as dflash-mlx adds new model families, omlx gets support automatically
- **Prefix caching**: explore chunked prefill with block-level KV save/restore for multi-turn conversation acceleration (requires dflash-mlx exposing cache manipulation APIs)
- **Benchmark integration**: add DFlash-specific benchmark metrics (acceptance ratio, draft/verify timing breakdown) to admin panel

"""End-to-end regression guards for V4 multi-session prefix cache.

The bug this commit chain fixes: when a DeepSeek V4 model handled a
prompt in session 1 and the same prompt arrived in session 2 (no
shared in-memory state, no continuation — just identical text), the
second session's first token came out garbage and the rest collapsed
into repetition. Disabling prefix cache made session 2 work; reloading
the model also worked. The cause was that omlx core stored only the
first two elements of every cache layer's state tuple, silently
dropping `PoolingCache.state[2]` (the `pooled` compressed-attention
buffer) on every save and reconstructing it as `None` on every load.

This module exercises the full extract → store → load → reconstruct
pipeline with a PoolingCache layer to confirm the third element
survives end-to-end. Each test is marked ``slow`` because the SSD
write path goes through a background thread; if a future regression
re-introduces the truncation, these tests will catch it before it
hits a real V4 model run.

// PR 13 — Benchmark DTOs (throughput + accuracy).
//
// Throughput mirrors omlx/admin/routes.py:/api/bench/* (start @4619,
// stream @4679, cancel @4724, results @4748). Accuracy mirrors
// /api/bench/accuracy/* (queue/add @4460, queue/status @4507, results
// @4531, reset @4547, cancel @4558, stream @4569).
//
// Both feature areas use *polling* in the Swift screens (the HTML uses
// SSE). The shape of `GET /api/bench/{id}/results` and
// `GET /api/bench/accuracy/results` matches what each respective SSE
// stream emits once aggregated, so polling produces functionally
// equivalent state — just without per-token granularity.

"""
Boundary Snapshot SSD Store for oMLX.

Stores non-sliceable cache layer snapshots (e.g. ArraysCache) to SSD during
prefill, freeing GPU memory immediately.  At request completion the snapshots
are loaded back one block at a time for final SSD cache storage.

Uses the same async-write pattern as PagedSSDCacheManager: tensors are
serialized to raw bytes on the inference thread (Metal-safe), buffered in
``_pending_writes`` for instant read-back, and flushed to disk by a
background writer thread via ``_write_safetensors_no_mx``.

        snapshots for this request — concurrent ``rmtree`` here would race
        the worker's :meth:`load` calls and silently strip block storage.
        :class:`omlx.scheduler.Scheduler` defers this call until the
        ``store_future`` for ``request_id`` is done.

        Acquires ``_writer_busy`` after marking the request cancelled so
        the writer thread can finish any item it is mid-processing first.
        Without this barrier the writer can pull an item, ``mkdir`` the

        comment at the bump site for the two distinct bugs that
        rules out (stale ``rid: 0`` after a timeout for an empty

        # The bump is additive (``get + count``) and skipped entirely

Scheduler for oMLX continuous batching.

This module provides a Scheduler class that manages request scheduling
using mlx-lm's BatchGenerator for efficient continuous batching.

The scheduler follows vLLM's design with:
- Waiting queue for pending requests
- Running set for active requests
- Continuous batching via BatchGenerator

        - mx.eval() (a FULL, blocking eval — NOT async_eval) was called on
          the inference thread for all KV cache arrays in cache_to_store, so
          they are fully materialized concrete buffers before this worker
          runs. This is the load-bearing invariant: MLX streams ARE
          thread-local (each engine's generation stream is created via
          mx.new_thread_local_stream on the inference thread). A KV array
          left lazy and bound to self._stream cannot be materialized on this
          worker thread — _extract_block_tensor_slice (slices) and
          _extract_tensor_bytes (bf16 -> uint16 view) would re-dispatch the
          source op to self._stream's index, which does NOT exist on this
          thread, aborting the process ("There is no Stream(gpu, N) in
          current thread"). Boundary snapshots get the same treatment via
          _eval_snapshot_cache at capture time.
        - Because the sources are concrete, the worker's own slice/view ops
          consume materialized buffers and bind their new ops to the
          always-present default stream (gpu,0). The _safe_sync_stream call
          below is now belt-and-suspenders (the owner already drained the
          work); correctness no longer depends on its cross-thread
          mx.synchronize, whose "no Stream" RuntimeError it tolerantly
          swallows.
        - All mx-buffer access here is held under _mx_buffer_access_lock,
          serializing the bf16 view+eval and the buffer-protocol reads
          against inference-thread _sync_and_clear_cache (which also takes
          that lock), so mx.clear_cache cannot reclaim a buffer mid-read.
        - batch_generator.remove(uid) is deferred until this worker
          completes (handled by _drain_pending_async_removes).

        paged_cache_manager and block_aware_cache rely on
        threading.RLock so concurrent access from main and worker is safe.

        """Size the next prefill chunk so its predicted peak stays under a
        safety margin below the hard cap.

        The chunk is sized so that ``current + predicted_transient(n) <=
        hard_cap * safety``. If the full requested chunk already fits, it runs
        unchanged — no behavior change on healthy traffic. Crucially the gate
        is on the *predicted peak*, not on current memory crossing the soft
        watermark: a single large chunk's transient (e.g. MoE prefill at tens
        of MB/token) can blow the ceiling from a low baseline before current
        ever reaches the watermark, which is the failure this prevents.

        Two predictors feed the sizing:
          - Measured: once the per-scheduler EWMA has samples, use its
            ``bytes_per_token`` (× the same 1.2 safety factor ``predict()``
            applies) — this is measurement-based and model-agnostic.
          - First chunk (no samples yet): fall back to the static SDPA + KV
            growth estimate for the requested candidate chunk. ``kv_len`` is
            the current context span (cached prefix + already-prefilled
            tokens), so a large prefix-cache hit with a small suffix is
            throttled correctly without classifying large prefill chunks as
            vector-path traffic.

        The discrete watermark tiers are retained as a *secondary clamp* —
        they only ever shrink further, never enlarge the predicted size.

        The chunk-end memory check (``self._memory_hard_limit_bytes``
        comparison in the prefill loops) remains the safety net: if memory
        still exceeds the cap after this shrink, the loop attempts reclaim
        (``_reclaim_prefill_headroom``) and, failing that, raises so the
        #1405 cleanup path can requeue or emit ``finish_reason="error"``.

        Args:
            requested: The chunk size the caller would have used without
                throttle (already clamped by boundary alignment).
            request_id: For debug log correlation.

        ``CacheBlock`` metadata back into the free queue (the pool never
        shrinks, see ``PagedCacheManager._grow_blocks``), so it is deliberately

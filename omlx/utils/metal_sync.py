"""Sync-before-clear primitive for the Metal buffer cache.

``mx.clear_cache()`` releases buffers from MLX's Metal buffer pool. If work
that references those buffers is still in flight, the driver can hit a
kernel panic, so every cache clear in oMLX has to drain the stream that
carried the work first. This module is the single home for that primitive
plus the lock that keeps it from racing the async store-cache worker.

Callers on an inference thread pass the stream their work rode on (the
per-engine stream for scheduler paths, ``BatchGenerator._stream`` inside
mlx-lm patches, the dependency's own stream where the dependency dispatched
the work). An mlx ``ThreadLocalStream`` resolves to a different concrete
``mx.Stream`` per calling thread, so the drain only covers the stream it is
given, resolved on the calling thread.

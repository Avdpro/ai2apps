                is ``min(chunk_size, new_tokens)`` since the last chunk
                cannot be larger than the remaining new tokens.
            cached_tokens: Tokens served from prefix cache. Added to
                ``new_tokens`` for the SDPA scores K-dim because those
                positions still participate in attention. Keyword-only with

    The shared front-door guard, taking token counts + watermarks directly so
    an engine without a ``Scheduler`` (``DFlashEngine``) enforces with the
    same math ``Scheduler.preflight_or_raise`` uses. No-op when the guard is
    disabled, no limit is set, the monitor is missing, or the request fits.
    The caller supplies ``current_usage_bytes`` so HTTP/event-loop preflight
    paths can use cached executor telemetry plus physical footprint without
    calling MLX directly. Maps to HTTP 400 via the server's
    ``prefill_memory_exceeded_handler``.

    ``cached_tokens`` means prompt KV *already resident in current memory*
    (e.g. the scheduler's paged prefix cache) — not merely "tokens that hit
    a cache". A cache whose hits re-allocate KV (DFlash prefix snapshots)
    must pass 0.

    The component ceilings are optional: callers that receive the
    enforcer's breakdown (the DFlash prefill guard) pass them so the
    rejection names the binding constraint the same way the scheduler's
    does. Callers that do not fall back to generic advice.

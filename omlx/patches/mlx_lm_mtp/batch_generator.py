"""Conditional MTP dispatch inside ``mlx_lm.generate.GenerationBatch``.

This is the integration point that lets the existing oMLX scheduler /
paged cache / prefix cache / SSD cache stack drive MTP without touching any
of those layers. ``GenerationBatch`` is mlx-lm's per-step decoder for the
active set of sequences in continuous batching. We patch:

- ``GenerationBatch.__init__`` — leave the standard mlx-lm initialization
  untouched. Fresh singleton donor batches may still be merged into a larger
  continuous batch, so MTP must not mutate cache state in ``__init__``.

- ``GenerationBatch.next`` — when the batch holds exactly one MTP-capable
  sequence, lazily initialize MTP from the standard post-prefill state. We
  emit from the per-batch queue first; once empty, we run a 2-token verify
  forward over ``[next_main, draft]`` with ``n_confirmed=1`` and a single
  MTP-head forward at the bonus position (accept) or confirmed position
  (reject), refilling the queue from the verify outputs.

- ``GenerationBatch.extend`` / ``filter`` — drop MTP state whenever continuous
  batching reshapes ownership. MTP state belongs to one uid in one singleton
  timeline; it must not survive standard batched decoding.

The throughput math (greedy, accept rate p):
  - Cost per *cycle*: 1× backbone (2-token verify) + 1× MTP head ≈ 1.15
  - Tokens per cycle: 1 + p (accept emits draft+bonus; reject emits verify_pred only)
  - At p≈1: 0.575 cost/token → ~1.74× throughput
  - At p≈0.5: ~0.77 cost/token → ~1.30× throughput

Known limitation (compute-bound single-stream Apple Silicon):
  The cost model above assumes the 2-token verify forward is nearly free
  relative to a 1-token forward, which is the bandwidth-bound decode regime
  speculative decoding targets. On lower-end single-stream Apple Silicon
  (e.g. M1/M2 base/Pro) decode is compute-bound, so the verify forward costs
  ~2× a 1-token forward and MTP can be net-negative regardless of accept
  rate. Wins are expected on M3/M4 or higher-end parts, on MoE models with a
  smaller per-step backbone, or under continuous batching where spare
  compute exists. See #1097 / #1311 for measurements.

Greedy identity (sampler is None): the patched dispatch produces the same
tokens as the standard step. PR 990's ``test_mtp_generate_identity``
encodes this contract; the oMLX-side equivalent lives in
``tests/test_mlx_lm_mtp_patch.py``.

Stochastic acceptance (sampler is not None): we use ``min(1, p_target / p_draft)``
(Leviathan & Chen 2023). On rejection we sample from the residual
``max(p_target - p_draft, 0) / Z`` so the marginal output distribution
equals the target distribution exactly.

PagedCacheManager interaction
-----------------------------
``cache.trim(1)`` on a ``BatchKVCache`` only updates ``self._idx``; the
underlying paged blocks are untouched. ``ArraysCache.rollback_state``
holds ``(conv_snap, ssm_snap)`` snapshots produced by the patched
``GatedDeltaNet.__call__`` and is restored on reject. Because both code
paths only mutate cache *length* (not block ownership), oMLX's
``PagedCacheManager`` is oblivious to the trim — its block_table is
unaffected and prefix-cache lookups continue to work normally.

TokenBuffer interaction
-----------------------
``GenerationBatch._token_context[0]`` is a ``TokenBuffer`` accumulating
the prompt + every forward-input token. We update it in lock-step with
each forward-input position so that ``logits_processors`` see the same
token sequence the standard step would see. On reject we shrink the
buffer's ``_size`` by 1 to discard the rejected draft (mirroring PR 990's
``prev_tokens = prev_tokens[:-1]``).

class _DepthController:
    """Adaptive draft-depth selection.

    Pure host-side bookkeeping — no extra GPU syncs. Tracks an EMA of
    conditional acceptance per depth position and a wall-time EMA of cycle
    cost per depth used, then picks the depth with the best expected tokens
    per unit time:

        score(d) = (1 + p1 + p1*p2 + ... ) / t_est(d)

    Everything the decision uses is measured on this machine, on this model,
    under the current load — no hand-tuned per-chip or per-model value:

    - Cost: a warmup sweep runs each depth once so every ``t[d]`` starts from
      a real cycle; the marginal cost of an extra verify row is the measured
      slope between depths (``_marginal_est``), so a fine-grained MoE on a
      bandwidth-limited chip learns its true (large) marginal within the first
      few cycles. ``MARGINAL_MS`` is only the pre-measurement fallback.
    - Drift: the cost EMA horizon is wall-clock (``TAU_MS``), not a cycle
      count, so context growth, thermal throttling and external GPU contention
      are tracked at constant real-time responsiveness however long a cycle
      is; a one-off slow cycle is damped (``SPIKE_RATIO``).
    - Staleness: only the depth currently run gets fresh measurements, and a
      fresh-vs-stale cost comparison is systematically biased — e.g. a depth
      whose t was measured during the slow post-prefill cycles looks expensive
      forever, so the controller locks into its rival (measured as a depth-2
      lock costing prose ~2-4%). Probes are therefore BIDIRECTIONAL and
      staleness-directed: on a wall-clock cadence, re-run the best rival depth
      (shallower or deeper) when its score is within ``PROBE_MARGIN`` of the
      current choice, and periodically the most-stale depth, so every t[d] has
      bounded age. On heavy models a fixed wall-clock cadence would spend a
      large share of cycles probing, so probing is duty-bounded to
      ~``PROBE_DUTY`` of cycles — a scale-free ratio, not a per-model tuning.

    Depth 0 — the escape hatch: speculation is only profitable while the
    multi-token verify forward is cheap relative to a plain decode step.
    On models with a large L=1 -> L=2 forward-cost jump (gemma4 head_dim
    256/512 leaves the single-token attention kernel; MoE expert loads
    scale with verify tokens) the whole depth menu can be worse than
    standard decoding — measured 0.67x on gemma4 26B story/16k with the
    best depth choice. Depth 0 runs the cycle as a plain 1-token step
    ([next_main] only, no drafts, no rollback) whose cost is tracked as
    ``t[0]`` through the same EMA/probe machinery, so the controller
    parks at 0 when every speculative depth loses and re-enters through
    the existing bidirectional probes. ``t[0]`` gets its first real
    measurement from the warmup sweep (which ends with one depth-0
    cycle) and stays fresh via parked cycles and the staleness explorer.
    Parking alone is not enough on fast backbones — a parked cycle still
    pays the MTP loop's synchronous host round-trip that the standard
    decoder pipelines away — so a sustained park hands the sequence back
    to the standard step entirely (``_park_mtp_to_standard``).

    Content-adaptive by construction: prose/chat settles at depth 1,
    code/predictable text climbs. Rejected alternatives (interleaved
    in-process A/B, rotated order, paired per rep, on Qwen3.6-35B-A3B +
    GLM-5.2, M3 Ultra): a fixed shallow-bias constant (won earlier separate-
    process comparisons only by masking the staleness lock; this design beats
    it on 3 of 4 model x content cells and ties the 4th), a pure realized
    tok/s bandit (exploration tax), a live per-cycle learned correction
    (decision churn), a frozen cross-generation correction (content
    oscillation), and a base x shape cost decomposition (unidentifiable while
    one depth runs for long stretches).

    ``state.next_main`` (already streamed, not yet in the cache), sample its
    successor as ``_next_tokens``, and drop the MTP state. The batch is
    marked so eligibility never re-activates MTP — the controller already
    proved speculation loses here, and the standard step's async pipelining
    is what the parked cycles cannot match.

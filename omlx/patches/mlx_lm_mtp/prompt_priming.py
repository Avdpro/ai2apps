"""MTP-head prompt priming: fold the prompt into the head cache during prefill.

Without priming the MTP head starts generation with an empty KV cache — its
first drafts see none of the prompt and acceptance starts context-starved,
recovering only as committed generation tokens accumulate (MTPLX measured
committed-history priming at 0.90 acceptance vs 0.26 unprimed on depth-1
real-code prompts). This module rides the existing prefill forwards: every
backbone chunk forward already computes the trunk-normed hidden for all chunk
positions, so the (hidden[t], token[t+1]) pairs the head history needs are
available for free. Each chunk is folded into a head cache immediately and
the chunk hidden is discarded — only a single (1, 1, H) pending row carries
across chunks.

Transport: the context lives in a single slot on the patched language-model
instance (the ``host``). Cache-entry attributes cannot carry it — mlx-lm's
insert merge rebuilds every layer cache that lacks filter/extract support
(all of DeepSeek-V4's and GLM-5.2's CacheList entries, and TurboQuant
replaces KVCache entries at end of prefill) — while the model instance is
the one object every forward and the activation both see. The engine thread
serializes forwards, and the offset-contiguity invariant below makes the
single slot safe across interleaved requests: a chunk from a different
request can never look contiguous with another request's timeline (its
first forward starts at offset 0), so it invalidates or restarts the slot,
and the activating request is always the slot's last writer.

Fail-safe invariant: every capture verifies the anchor offset advanced
contiguously since the previous capture (``expected_offset``). Any rewind,
trim, request switch, or unknown cache path breaks the equality and
invalidates the context, degrading to the current unprimed behaviour —
never to a wrong history.

Capture sites (each calls :func:`maybe_capture` after the backbone forward):

- mlx-lm qwen3_5 text path: the patched ``TextModel.__call__``
  (``qwen35_model``), which computes the trunk-normed hidden inline.
- mlx-vlm qwen3_5 path: a wrap on the inner ``Qwen3_5Model.__call__``
  (``qwen35_vlm_runtime``), whose return value *is* the trunk-normed
  hidden; the MoE inner model inherits it. The outer ``LanguageModel`` is
  reached via a weakref stamped at init.
- DeepSeek-V4 (``deepseek_v4_model``): the patched ``Model.__call__``
  requests ``return_raw_hidden`` and passes the raw 4D Hyper-stream hidden
  (the head input variant; no trunk norm).
- GLM-5.2 (``glm_moe_dsa_model``): the patched ``Model.__call__`` passes
  the post-final-norm hidden it already computes.

All sites skip ``return_hidden=True`` forwards (MTP verify cycles and the
activation forward in ``_post_init_mtp``); the final (hidden[prompt[-1]],
main_tok) pair is folded by :func:`take_primed` at activation instead.

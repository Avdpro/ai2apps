"""Native MTP (Multi-Token Prediction) monkey-patches for mlx-lm.

This package adapts two upstream PRs into runtime monkey-patches:

- ml-explore/mlx-lm#990 — Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 native MTP heads (dense + MoE)
- Blaizzy/mlx-lm#15    — DeepSeek-V4-Flash native MTP heads

Both PRs follow the same shape: a model gains an extra ``mtp`` module + a
``mtp_forward`` method and an enhanced ``__call__`` that returns hidden
states alongside logits. A separate ``mtp_generate_step`` generator drives
the draft/verify loop using those hooks.

This package implements the model-side hooks as in-place monkey-patches and
folds the draft/verify loop into mlx-lm's ``GenerationBatch.next()`` so the
existing oMLX paged + prefix + SSD cache stack keeps working unchanged.

Activation gate: caller (utils/model_loading.py) checks
``model_settings.mtp_enabled`` and the model's ``config.json`` for MTP
heads + a supported ``model_type`` before invoking ``apply_mlx_lm_mtp_patch``.
The patches are idempotent.

Concurrency model: the BatchGenerator patch uses the singleton MTP path for
one active sequence, and a row-wise MTP controller for multi-sequence batches
only when every row is at the same target cache position. Late-join or otherwise
unaligned batches fall through to standard continuous batching.

    else (e.g. dflash hooks) has overwritten ``__call__`` since the
    last load. Without this, a sequence like (dflash → mtp) on the
    same process leaves the linear-attention class patched by dflash

    ``__init__`` / ``sanitize`` / ``from_dict`` paths see MTP weights.

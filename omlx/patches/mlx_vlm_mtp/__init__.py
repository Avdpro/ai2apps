"""Native MTP monkey-patches for mlx-vlm.

mlx-vlm ships its own ``Model.sanitize`` for VLM checkpoints
(Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration etc). The stock body unconditionally
strips ``mtp.*`` weights and only shifts a fixed set of backbone norm
keys by +1 — the MTP head's own norms (``mtp.norm.weight``,
``mtp.pre_fc_norm_*.weight`` and the per-block layernorms) miss the
shift, so MTP layers run with raw RMSNorm weights after quantization.

This package patches the affected mlx-vlm Model classes so the sanitize
output keeps ``mtp.*`` and applies the +1 norm shift to every MTP norm,
matching what mlx-lm PR 990 does on the LLM side.

Activation: oQ quantization invokes ``apply_mlx_vlm_mtp_patch`` before
building the VLM sanitizer. The patches are idempotent.

# (e.g. unsloth Qwen3.6 UD MLX builds, issue #1426). Without the gate,
# strict load fails with "Missing N parameters" and the engine silently
# falls back to LLM, dropping vision.
